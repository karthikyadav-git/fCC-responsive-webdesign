1. `main` element with id `main-doc`
2. In `main-doc`, several sections each with class `main-section`
3. first element of each `main-section` should be a `header` element, which describes the topic of the section
4. Each `section` element with class `main-section` should have an id that corresponds to the text in header. eg. for header **JavaScript and Java**, the id should be `JavaScript_and_Java`

8. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding id `navbar`
9. Each `navbar` element should have a `header` element that describes the topic of the Technical Documentation
10. The navbar should contain `a` elements with `nav-link` class. There should be one for every `main-section` element.
11. In `#navbar`, `header` must come before any `a`
12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section`
13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element
