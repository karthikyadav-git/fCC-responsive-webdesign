      <h2>God of Sight</h2>
      <p>Sanduk Ruit (Nepali: सन्दुक रूइत, pronounced [ˈsʌnduk rui̯t], born September 4, 1954) is an ophthalmologist
        from Nepal who was involved to restore the sight of over 180,000 people across Africa and Asia using
        small-incision cataract surgery.</p>
      <p>Ruit is the founder and the executive director of the Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, which manufactures
        intraocular lenses for surgical implantation at a fraction of the previous manufacturing cost. The low cost has
        made cataract surgeries slightly cheaper in Nepal.</p>
      <p>Ruit has been referred to as the <b>"God of Sight"</b>. He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and
        International Understanding, considered to be the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize, for <em>"placing Nepal at
          the
          forefront of developing safe, effective, and economical procedures for cataract surgery, enabling the
          needlessly
          blind in even the poorest countries to see again."</em> He was awarded with the Isa award, the highest
        civilian
        award
        in Bahrain by the king of Bahrain for developing highly affordable and sustainable ways to cure cataracts
        throughout the developing world with a cash prize of 1 million dollars.</p>
